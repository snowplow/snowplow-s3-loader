# Snowplow S3 Loader

## Overview

The Snowplow S3 Loader consumes records from an [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis] stream and writes them to S3.

There are 2 file formats supported:
 * LZO
 * GZip

### LZO

The records are treated as raw byte arrays. [Elephant Bird's][elephant-bird] `BinaryBlockWriter` class is used to serialize them as a [Protocol Buffers][protobufs] array (so it is clear where one record ends and the next begins) before compressing them.

The compression process generates both compressed .lzo files and small .lzo.index files ([splittable LZO][hadoop-lzo]). Each index file contain the byte offsets of the LZO blocks in the corresponding compressed file, meaning that the blocks can be processed in parallel.

### GZip

The records are treated as byte arrays containing UTF-8 encoded strings (whether CSV, JSON or TSV). New lines are used to separate records written to a file. This format can be used with the Snowplow Kinesis Enriched stream, among other streams.

## Quickstart

#### Docker

```bash
docker run snowplow/snowplow-s3-loader:2.1.4 --help
```

#### Download jar

```bash
curl -Lo snowplow-s3-loader.jar https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-s3-loader/releases/download/2.1.4/snowplow-s3-loader-2.1.4.jar
java -jar snowplow-s3-loader.jar --help
```

#### Build it yourself

Assuming git and [SBT][sbt] installed:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-s3-loader.git
$ cd snowplow-s3-loader
$ sbt assembly
```

## Prerequisites

You must have `lzop` and `lzop-dev` installed. In Ubuntu, install them like this:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install lzop liblzo2-dev
```

## Command Line Interface

The Snowplow S3 Loader has the following command-line interface:

```
snowplow-s3-loader: Version 2.1.4

Usage: snowplow-s3-loader [options]

--config <filename>
```

## Running

Create your own config file:

```bash
$ cp config/config.hocon.sample my.conf
```

You will need to edit all fields in the config.  Consult [the configuration reference][config] of the setup guide on how to fill in the fields.

Next, start the sink, making sure to specify your new config file:

```bash
$ java -jar snowplow-s3-loader-2.1.4.jar --config my.conf
```
